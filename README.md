# prework-study-guide


## Description

The project got me aquatinted to the basics and concepts of understanding the languages in programming. This project was built in order for me to understand some of the fundamentals which I will be using in my course. Problems I solved in relation to coding were the concepts of flow and logic. I learnt how important the Git and Git Hub is to managing and tracking my changes in my work.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
